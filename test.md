# Project: Eco-Friendly Smart Home Mobile App

## Overview
We want to build a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) that allows users to monitor and control their smart home devices with a focus on energy efficiency. The app will connect to smart plugs, thermostats, and lighting systems.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login with email and biometrics.
2. **Dashboard**: Real-time energy consumption overview.
3. **Device Management**: Add, remove, and configure smart devices.
4. **Automation Rules**: "If this, then that" style rules for energy saving (e.g., turn off lights when nobody is home).
5. **Gamification**: Badges and leaderboards for energy savings compared to neighbors.

## Technical Constraints
- Use React Native for the frontend.
- Node.js backend with GraphQL.
- Deployment on AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).
- Timeline: 3 months aggressive target.

## Known Risks
- Integration with older legacy smart protocols (Zigbee/Z-Wave) might be tricky without a dedicated hub.
- Security concerns regarding IoT device access.
- App Store approval delays.

## Resources
- 1 Lead Developer
- 2 Mobile Developers
- 1 UX/UI Designer
- 1 Backend Engineer
- 1 QA Tester
